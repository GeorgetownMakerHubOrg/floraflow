# FloraFlow

FloraFlow is a minimal-maintenance plant-watering system that can automatically water plants on four different schedules. The system is designed to not require refilling for weeks or months at a time, while also retaining and recyling nutrients through a semi-closed-loop water cycle.

The system is currently under development and is designed to hang on the eastern window railing of the MakerHub.

The system can water up to 8 plants in 3.5" x 3.5" pots arranged in a 2x4 grid. Each watering channel can take care of 2 pots. The system allows people to their own plants here for some time of display and care.
