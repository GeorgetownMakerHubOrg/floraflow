# FloraFlow

FloraFlow is a minimal-maintenance plant-watering system that can automatically water plants following three different schedules. The system is designed to not require refilling for weeks or months at a time, while also retaining and recyling nutrients through a semi-closed-loop water cycle.

The system is currently under development and is designed to hang on the eastern window railing of the MakerHub.

The system can water up to 6 plants in 3.5" x 3.5" pots arranged in a 2x3 grid. Each watering channel can take care of 2 pots. The system allows people to put their own plants here for some time of display and care. 

The goal of this project is to give people opportunities to learn about various tools around the MakerHub and to provide MakerHub with a fun installation that not only engages visitors but also inspires students to learn to use tools to build their own projects as well.

## On-boarding

To familiarize yourself with the build, go to [design/](https://github.com/GeorgetownMakerHubOrg/floraflow/tree/main/design) to first read about the design, then go to [teams/](https://github.com/GeorgetownMakerHubOrg/floraflow/tree/main/teams) to see which teams you are interested in joining. There is no limit to the number of teams you can join ;)
